Technical Stack Document1. IntroductionThis document outlines the proposed technical stack for [Project Name], a full-stack application. The choices are driven by the need for high performance, safety, maintainability, and leveraging the benefits of a unified language across the stack.2. Core PrinciplesPerformance & Safety: Leverage Rust's compile-time guarantees and zero-cost abstractions.Unified Language: Use Rust for both frontend and backend development to reduce context switching and share code.Reactive & Efficient UI: Utilize a modern framework for efficient DOM updates.Scalability: Choose components that can scale with user growth and data volume.Developer Experience: Select tools and frameworks that offer good ergonomics and community support.3. Proposed Technical Stack3.1. Programming LanguageRust: The primary language for the entire application.3.2. Frontend Framework: Leptos Reasoning: Full-stack framework enabling isomorphic Rust code. Offers fine-grained reactivity for efficient UI updates, strong typing, and excellent performance by compiling to WebAssembly (WASM). Supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and hydration for SEO and initial load performance.Styling:Tailwind CSS: For utility-first CSS, enabling rapid UI development and consistent design.PostCSS (with Autoprefixer): For processing CSS and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.Client-Side Tooling:WebAssembly (WASM): The compilation target for the Leptos frontend code.3.3. BackendWeb Framework: Axum (or Actix-web/Warp as alternatives)Reasoning (Axum): Built on Tokio and Tower, offering a highly ergonomic and performant asynchronous web server. Integrates well with Leptos's server functions. Known for its strong type safety and robust middleware ecosystem.Server Functions: Leptos Server FunctionsReasoning: Enables seamless RPC calls from the frontend to backend Rust functions, simplifying client-server communication and maintaining type safety across the boundary.Asynchronous Runtime: TokioReasoning: The de-facto standard asynchronous runtime for Rust, providing the foundation for Axum and other async libraries.3.4. Database & Data PersistenceDatabase: PostgreSQLReasoning: A powerful, open-source, and highly reliable relational database. Offers advanced features, strong data integrity, and excellent performance.ORM/Query Builder: SQLxReasoning: A pure Rust asynchronous SQL crate that provides compile-time checked queries. This ensures that SQL queries are valid against the database schema before runtime, significantly reducing a class of common errors. Supports various databases, including PostgreSQL.(Alternative: Diesel - if a more traditional ORM with schema migrations and a query DSL is preferred, though SQLx often preferred for compile-time query checks and async support).3.5. Build & Development ToolingBuild Tool: TrunkReasoning: The recommended build tool for Leptos applications. Handles compiling Rust to WASM, bundling assets (CSS, JS), setting up a development server with hot-reloading, and managing server-side compilation.Package Manager: Cargo (Rust's official package manager)Reasoning: Manages dependencies, builds projects, and runs tests for Rust applications.Code Formatting: rustfmtReasoning: Standard Rust code formatter for consistent code style.Linting: clippyReasoning: Rust linter to catch common mistakes and improve code quality.3.6. Deployment (Conceptual)Containerization: DockerCloud Provider: [e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Fly.io]CI/CD: [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD]4. Architecture OverviewThe application will follow a client-server architecture. The Leptos frontend, compiled to WebAssembly, will run in the user's browser. It will communicate with the Axum backend server, which handles API requests (including Leptos server functions) and interacts with the PostgreSQL database via SQLx. Trunk will orchestrate the build process for both client and server components.5. Justification for Key ChoicesRust: Chosen for its performance, memory safety, concurrency features, and growing ecosystem, allowing a single language for the entire stack.Leptos: Provides a highly efficient and ergonomic way to build reactive UIs in Rust, with built-in SSR and server function capabilities critical for a full-stack approach.Axum: Modern, async, and type-safe backend framework that integrates seamlessly with Leptos.SQLx: Ensures robust and compile-time validated database interactions, crucial for data integrity and developer confidence.Document Version: 1.0Date: July 13, 2025Author: [Your Name/Team]
